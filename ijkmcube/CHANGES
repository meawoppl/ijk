ijkmcube:

Version 0.2.6: Implemented  -octree and -region option with -snap option.

Version 0.2.7: Revised -snap option to break snapping ties by smallest
vertex index.  Program ijkmcube with "-snap D" or "-snap D -region L"
or "-snap D -octree" options should produce same set of isosurface vertices
and simplices.  (Vertices and simplices may not be in the same order.)
